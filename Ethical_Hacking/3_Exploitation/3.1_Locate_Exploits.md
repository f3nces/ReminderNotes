## Definition

+ Exploit 
+ Payload - pieces of code injected by an exploit module into the victim machine or service (needed to run an exploit)
  + Inline (Non-Staged) - containing the exploit and full shell code for the selected task. Not always supported (large size)
  + Staged - sends payload in stages (can be less stable)
    + Stagers - setup a network connection between the attacker and victim and are designed to be small and reliable
    + Stages - payload components that are downloaded by Stagers modules
