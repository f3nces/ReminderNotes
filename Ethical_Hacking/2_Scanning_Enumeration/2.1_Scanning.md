## Scanning

### Phases of Scanning

+ **Host Discovery** - discovering live systems (workstations, servers, routers, switches, access points, etc) 
+ **Port Scanning** - identifying open TCP and UDP ports 
+ **Service and Application Version Detection** - identifying services and the versions of services that are listening on open ports
+ **OS Fingerprinting** - determining the operating system of alive computers
+ **Vulnerability Scanning** - identifying known vulnerabilities in known network services and applications



### Network Scanning Tools

+ Standard network scanner
  
+ **Nmap** Security Scanner (Zenmap is official GUI)
+ **fping**
  
  ```bash
  -a #shows only alive hosts
  -g #perform a ping sweep(which ip's are assigned) instead a standard ping
  fping -a -g <CIDR>
  fping -a -g <startIP-endIP>
  ```
  
  
  
+ Scanners for Internet-wide probing (designed for performance): 
  
  + **Zmap**
